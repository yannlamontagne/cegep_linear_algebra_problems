A \emph{median} of a triangle is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Prove that the three medians of any triangle intersect at a common point $G$ that is two-thirds of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. (The point $G$ is called the \emph{centroid} of the triangle.)
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
In the triangle $ABC$ with midpoints $PQR$, show that the point that is two thirds of the distance from $A$ to $P$ is given by $\frac{1}{3}(\vec{a}+\vec{b}+\vec{c})$. Then show that $\frac{1}{3}(\vec{a}+\vec{b}+\vec{c})$ is two thirds of the distance from $B$ to $Q$ and two thirds of the distance from $C$ to $R$.
\end{Answer}
